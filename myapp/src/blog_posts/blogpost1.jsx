        Best Budget Cars for First-Time Buyers in Nigeria
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Buying your first car is a big milestone—it symbolizes freedom, responsibility, 
        and independence. For many Nigerians, especially young professionals, graduates, 
        or people just starting out, getting the right car is about balancing dreams 
        with practicality. While you may want a luxury SUV or a sleek brand-new ride, 
        your budget often demands something reliable, affordable, and cost-efficient. 
        The Nigerian car market is unique, with options ranging from Tokunbo (foreign used) 
        cars to Nigerian-used vehicles. Knowing what to look for can save you both money 
        and stress in the long run.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In this article, we’ll explore the best budget-friendly cars that first-time buyers 
        in Nigeria can consider. We’ll discuss not only their prices but also their availability 
        of spare parts, fuel efficiency, and long-term reliability—all crucial factors 
        for someone purchasing their very first car.
      </p>

      {/* Toyota Corolla */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
        1. Toyota Corolla (Used)
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The Toyota Corolla has earned its legendary status for a reason. Across Nigeria, 
        it’s one of the most common vehicles you’ll see on the road. Why? Because it offers 
        unbeatable reliability, fuel efficiency, and low maintenance costs. Spare parts 
        are widely available in almost every city—from Lagos to Abuja to Port Harcourt. 
        If you ever run into mechanical problems, you’ll also find that virtually every 
        mechanic knows how to fix a Corolla.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        A Tokunbo Corolla from the early 2000s is usually priced between{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">₦2.5 million – ₦4.5 million</span>, depending on the model year 
        and overall condition. Nigerian-used versions go for less, but it’s always important 
        to check for accident history, mileage, and proper documentation before making a purchase.
      </p>

      {/* Honda Civic */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
        2. Honda Civic (Early 2000s Models)
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If you want something stylish yet practical, the Honda Civic is another excellent 
        choice. The Civic’s design is slightly sportier than the Corolla’s, making it a 
        favorite among younger drivers. It offers smooth handling, comfort, and good 
        durability when properly maintained.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        However, compared to Toyota, spare parts for Honda vehicles can sometimes be 
        more expensive. Still, they are widely available in major Nigerian markets 
        like Ladipo in Lagos or Nkpor in Onitsha. A Nigerian-used Civic typically ranges 
        between <span className="font-semibold">₦1.8 million – ₦3.5 million</span>, 
        while Tokunbo options might be priced slightly higher. For someone buying 
        their first car, the Civic gives a good blend of affordability and class.
      </p>

      {/* Kia Rio & Hyundai Accent */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">
        3. Kia Rio / Hyundai Accent
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        For buyers who want something modern yet budget-friendly, the Kia Rio and 
        Hyundai Accent are two solid contenders. They are compact sedans that share 
        similar parts and offer great fuel economy. Many Nigerians shy away from 
        Korean brands, but the truth is, these cars are increasingly proving 
        themselves on Nigerian roads.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The biggest advantage? Price. Tokunbo Kia Rio or Hyundai Accent models 
        from around 2007–2011 can often be found between{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">₦1.5 million – ₦3 million</span>. Spare parts 
        may not be as cheap as Toyota’s, but they are still accessible, especially 
        in Lagos and Abuja. For someone just starting out, these cars deliver value 
        without draining your pocket.
