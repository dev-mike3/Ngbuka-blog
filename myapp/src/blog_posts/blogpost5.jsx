        Top 10 Car Maintenance Tips Every Owner Should Know
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        A car is one of the biggest investments you’ll make, and just like any valuable 
        possession, it needs proper care to last long. Regular maintenance doesn’t just 
        extend your car’s lifespan — it also keeps you safe, saves you money, and maintains 
        your car’s resale value. Whether you’re driving in the busy streets of Lagos, 
        Abuja, or anywhere else, here are the <span className="font-semibold">top 10 
        car maintenance tips every owner should know</span>.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 1 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">1. Check Engine Oil Regularly</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Oil is the lifeblood of your engine. Always check the oil level at least once a month 
        and change it according to your manufacturer’s schedule. Driving with dirty or low oil 
        can cause engine wear or complete breakdown.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 2 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2. Inspect and Replace Air Filters</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        A clean air filter improves fuel efficiency and engine performance. Dust and dirt from 
        Nigerian roads can clog filters quickly, so replace them every 12,000–15,000 km or as needed.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 3 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3. Maintain Proper Tire Pressure</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Underinflated tires increase fuel consumption and wear out faster, while overinflated ones 
        reduce traction. Check your tire pressure weekly and don’t forget the spare tire.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 4 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">4. Rotate and Balance Tires</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        To ensure even wear, rotate your tires every 8,000–10,000 km. Proper balancing and alignment 
        also prevent vibrations and extend tire life.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 5 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5. Check Brake Pads and Fluid</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Brakes are a critical safety component. If you hear squealing noises or feel vibrations, 
        it’s time to replace your brake pads. Also, check brake fluid regularly to maintain stopping power.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 6 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">6. Inspect Battery Health</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        A dead battery can leave you stranded. Check for corrosion on terminals, ensure the 
        connections are tight, and replace the battery every 3–5 years depending on usage.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 7 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">7. Flush and Refill Coolant</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Overheating is common in Nigeria’s hot climate. Make sure your radiator has enough coolant 
        and flush the system every 40,000–50,000 km to prevent engine overheating.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 8 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">8. Replace Worn-Out Wiper Blades</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Good visibility is vital for safety, especially during rainy season. Replace wiper blades 
        every 6–12 months or when they start streaking.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 9 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">9. Pay Attention to Warning Lights</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Never ignore dashboard warning lights. Whether it’s the check engine, oil, or tire pressure 
        indicator, address issues immediately to avoid costly repairs.
      </p>

      {/* Tip 10 */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">10. Schedule Regular Professional Servicing</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        While DIY checks are good, taking your car to a trusted mechanic for a full inspection ensures 
        hidden issues are spotted and fixed early. Stick to your manufacturer’s recommended service intervals.
      </p>

      {/* Conclusion */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Following these simple but effective maintenance tips will keep your car running smoothly, 
        save you from unexpected breakdowns, and increase its resale value. Remember, 
        <span className="font-semibold"> a well-maintained car is a reliable car</span> — and it will 
        always reward you with peace of mind on the road.
